title: Everything minty is good
---

<p>Yesterday I washed my hair with this newfangled Head & Shoulders shampoo called "Refresh". It's basically shampoo with mint, and it supposedly creates a refreshing, "wake-me-up" feeling. To me, it felt like washing my hair with Vicks VapoRub while eating a Halls and brushing my teeth at the same time. I was coughing and sputtering and my eyes were stinging... a generally unpleasant experience.<br><br><br><br>I can just picture the marketing people who came up with this..<br><br><br><br><span>Marketing Executive #1:</span> "I've got an idea... minty shampoo."<br><br><br><br><span>Marketing Executive #2:</span> "Excellent idea!"<br><br><br><br><span>Marketing Executive #1:</span> "Yes... because <span>everything minty is good!</span>"<br><br><br><br><span>Marketing Executive #2:</span> "Wait... didn't you also invent Sprite Ice?"<br><br><br><br>What's next, Bacon Double McMinty with Cheese?<br><br></p>
