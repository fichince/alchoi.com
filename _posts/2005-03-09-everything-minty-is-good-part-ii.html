title: Everything minty is good, part II
---

<p>So there's this new "flavour" of Tylenol called Tylenol "Cool Burst".  You know what it is?  It's minty Tylenol.  <i>Minty!</i>  <b><i>Tylenol!!</i></b><br><br>Why is this even necessary? The ideas of pills is that you swallow them. Do they really want people to pop in a couple of Tylenols and start sucking on them like candy? "Mmm... minty... refreshing... maybe I'll have 10 more."<br><br>I'm getting pretty tired of this notion that everything has to be minty. The only things that should be minty are mouthwash, breath drops, toothpaste and other oral hygiene products. I don't want to eat it, I don't want to drink it, I don't want to wash my hair with it. Just take your mint and keep it to yourself, thank you.<br><br><span>(This is a sequel to <a href="http://logicalwaste.blogspot.com/2004/12/everything-minty-is-good.html">another post</a>)</span></p>
