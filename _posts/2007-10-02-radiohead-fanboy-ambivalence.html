title: Radiohead fanboy ambivalence
---

<p>So Radiohead announced the release of a new album called "<a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/" title="In Rainbows">In Rainbows</a>", coming out October 10th.  I don't think I've ever seen an album announcement so close to its release date.  Usually there's months of anticipation before a release, but this time they've decided to spring this on us on short notice.  Like "Hey, new album next week!"  Apparently, they're able to do this because they're no longer signed to a record contract; this is basically an "indie" release.<br><br>Because of their newly gained indie status, the band is also doing things a little differently in terms of distributing and pricing the release.  The album is coming out as an online download at first.  The price: "<a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/ItsReallyUptoYou.html" title="It's up to you.">It's up to you.</a>"  Kind of like selling it through an honour system.  You can even download it for free, and they won't mind.  (I'm going to give them a couple of bucks anyway.  You know, for their trouble.)  This is great and very forward-thinking of them, and gives fanboys like myself ammunition when discussing the greatness of Radiohead with fans of other, more inferior bands.<br><br>BUT<br><br>They're also selling the album as a boxset to be released later this year.  The boxset will have CD and vinyl versions of the album, which makes for good collector's items to be sure.  But the thing that's killing me is, there's a second CD with more songs, that's <i>only available in the boxset</i>.  It's like they're selling a double album where you can download the first part for free, but you have to buy the special collector's edition for the second part.  And how much is the boxset?  Â£40.  Or about $80 CAD.  (Or $80 USD, ha!)  That's a long way from "It's up to you."<br><br>I know I'll probably buy the boxset anyways, and the fanboy in me wants to forgive them, but this is really a rip-off.  It's like they're trying to trick us into thinking they're really cool by giving away the free download, just so we'll be happy to spend the money on the boxset.  I only hope they'll come to their senses and make the second CD available as a standalone purchase.  Otherwise, I'm boycotting Radiohead forever.  Oh, who am I kidding?  I love you, Thom Yorke.<br><br><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/radiohead" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/inrainbows" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/in+rainbows" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fanboy" rel="tag"></a></p>
