title: Accident humour on Wikipedia
---

<p>So I was looking up the word "cunt" on Wikipedia.  I am not going to explain myself.  Of particular interest was the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt#Other_meanings" title="Other meanings">Other meanings</a>" section.  There is this picture there:<br><br><a href="http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58d6db6c5016e1c3ee620995/1490476931428-6QMN7XUR4HBC7MDWF6P4/Picture%25201.png"><img border="0" src="http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58d6db6c5016e1c3ee620995/1490476931527-YLFKVOYXRY8V3IS1OB4K/Picture%25201.png" alt=""></a><br>Maybe it's just my dirty misogynistic mind, but isn't this <span>absolutely hilarious?</span>  Especially after reading the rest of the article about all the vulgar sexist connotations of the word, this caption has at least two interpretations which made me laugh out loud.  To figure out what two interpretations I mean, I leave as an exercise to the reader.<br><a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wikipedia" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/humour" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/funny" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/cunt" rel="tag"></a></p>
