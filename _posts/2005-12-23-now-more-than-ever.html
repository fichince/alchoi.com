title: '"Now... more than ever"'
---

<p>One of the promos they play on 680 News is the Deep Voice Radio Man saying "Now... more than ever... you need 680 News... so tune in for news, weather..." etc., etc.  No disrespect to 680 News, I listen to it all the time, but the expression "Now... more than ever" is one of those marketing clichés that fills me with dark hatred and righteous indignation.  <br><br>Let us dissect this "clever" turn of phrase.<br><br>If we are to assume that this is actually true, that we need 680 News <span>NOW</span> more than <span>EVER</span>, then this implies that at any given moment, our need for 680 News is greater than at any other time in the past.  That is, our need for 680 News (call this β), is a non-decreasing function of time, <span>t</span>.  To illustrate:<br><br><center><img src="http://img476.imageshack.us/img476/534/graph9xl.png"><br></center><br><br>  So eventually, our need for 680 News will reach infinity, and we will all   become helplessly glued to the radio.<br><br>  (If this post seemed kind of crazy, I am just trying to demonstrate how we use   certain expressions and phrases that don't really make sense if you think   about it.  This kind of thing is especially prevalent in marketing;   working in the tech industry, I've seen plenty of impressive-sounding, but   empty, doublespeak to promote products.  Perhaps a topic for a future post.)</p>
