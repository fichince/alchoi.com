title: The British and Baba Skins
---

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During my recent trip to Cuba, I had the opportunity to observe the mysterious culture of the British people.... actually, it's more like, I had the opportunity to be completely confused by what they they were talking about.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br> I was sitting on a catamaran at the time, on a boat tour around some of the coral reefs near the island.  A small boat is the perfect place for eavesdropping, as you can't help but overhear conversations in such a small space.  Most of the other tourists on the boat were British, and one particular retirement-age couple were talking to the captain of the boat, a local Cuban man.  They said to him, "Has anyone ever told you you look like baba skins?"<br><br><span>Baba skins??</span>  Some sort of English culinary item?  Like potato skins?  I don't care how delicious it is, but I wouldn't want anyone telling me I look like a plate of food.<br><br> "I'm not familiar with him.  I like Rowan Atkinson, though, he is also British," said the boat captain.<br><br> Okay, so it must be a British comedian or entertainer of some sort, as yet unknown in North America.  Maybe "Baba Skins" is a goofy stage name, like Carrot Top.  (still thinking food, here)<br><br> The British couple tried to clarify.  "He was in that Jennifer Lopez movie... Maid In Manhattan."<br><br> Hmm... haven't seen that one.<br><br> "He was also in that cartoon... what was it called?  Roger Rabbit!"<br><br> Ah!  <span>BOB HOSKINS!</span>  Amazingly, the boat captain actually agreed: "Oh, yes, I do look like him!"<br><br> The funny thing is, he didn't even look like Bob Hoskins... he looked more like Phil Collins.<br><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/british" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/english" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cuba" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bob+hoskins" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/humour" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/vacation" rel="tag"></a></div>
