<p>When you are going bumper bowling and your kid unleashes a weak shot that stops in the middle of the lane, do not try to walk on the lane to get the ball.  The lanes are waxed and thus very slippery, and you will fall, perhaps causing your glasses to fly comically through the air.  When you get up and try to act like nothing happened, please be aware that everybody saw that and is laughing at you.<br><br>On second thought... don't take your kids bowling at all, because they obviously cannot really bowl and will only hurt themselves trying to do so.  Thank you.</p>
