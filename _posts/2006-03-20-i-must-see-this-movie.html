title: I must see this movie...

<p>This is some screwed-up shit... the synopsis on the trailer page:</p><blockquote>The core idea of Drawing Restraint 9 is the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity, a theme it symbolically tracks through the construction and transformation of a vast sculpture of liquid Vaseline, called "The Field", which is molded, poured, bisected and reformed on the deck of the ship over the course of the film.</blockquote><p>Vast sculpture of liquid Vaseline?? Called "The Field"?! I don't care about all that... it's got Bj√∂rk! And Japanese people!</p><p>Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/bjork">bjork</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/movies">movies</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/crazy">crazy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/drawing+restraint+9">drawing restraint 9</a></p>
