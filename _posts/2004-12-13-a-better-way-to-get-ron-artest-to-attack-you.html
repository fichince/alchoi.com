title: A better way to get Ron Artest to attack you

<p>NBA fans have something to learn from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=319228&cc=5901">these</a> Brazilian soccer fans.  From the story, "Police in Sao Paulo said they had apprehended around 200 flip-flops which Palmeiras fans had intended to throw at their own team ... Supporters said they had symbolised the 'sandals of humility' which they suggested the players needed to wear."  So the next time someone feels like starting a riot at a basketball game, forget about that plastic cup filled with liquid.... throw your Nikes and Reeboks of humility!<br><br></p>
