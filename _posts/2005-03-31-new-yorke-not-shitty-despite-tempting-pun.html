title: New Yorke not shitty, despite tempting pun
---

<p>A few days ago, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a song called "Arpeggi" at something called the Ether Festival. The song has a simple melody sung by Thom, and it's backed by a sequence of repeated tones played by Jonny on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondes_martenot">ondes martenot</a>. At the end, they're joined by an orchestra, which sounds great. There's a very ethereal feeling to the whole thing. The song is probably in the early stages of development, so it might not even end up being a song, but as an idea, it's very promising. Apparently, the band have been spending some time in the studio recently, working on some new music. I look forward to hearing more.<br><br><a href="http://s40.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=3SPKY8VIWO1EZ20AFR7CHEYV35">MP3 of Arpeggi</a><br><br><span>(By the way, I wish I could claim credit for the joke in the heading, but I actually saw it on some website back when the <span>Hail to the Thief</span> stuff was first being revealed.  I'm not <span>that</span> clever.)</span></p>
