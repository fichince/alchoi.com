title: God agrees with my review of The Da Vinci Code
---

<p>Looks like Dan Brown, with his book <span>The Da Vinci Code</span>, has incurred the <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2005-03-16T160602Z_01_L16717165_RTRIDST_0_ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS-VATICAN-DAVINCI-DC.XML">wrath of God</a>. Apparently, the Vatican is very displeased with the novel, and has sent a Cardinal on a mission to urge Catholics to shun it. Choice quote from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone: "Don't buy this. Don't read this because this is rotten food... A lot of novels do good but this book is rotten food ... it does harm, not good."<br><br>Nice to know I have the Vatican <a href="http://logicalwaste.blogspot.com/2004/12/book-review-da-vinci-code.html">on my side</a>.<br><br>(All kidding aside though, I actually found the theories about Christ, as presented in <span>The Da Vinci Code<span><span></span></span></span>, pretty interesting... I just thought it was poorly written and poorly plotted.)</p>
