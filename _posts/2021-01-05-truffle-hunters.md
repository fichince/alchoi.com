[_The Truffle Hunters_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394318/) is a documentary film about a bunch of old dudes in Italy who work with dogs to find truffles[^1] buried in the ground, deep inside forests. As a dog lover, I envy the working relationship that these people have with their dogs. My dog is great, but she's never going to help me write any Javascript.

The film is visually gorgeous, made up mostly of static shots that are perfectly composed, lit and colour-graded. One shot that springs to mind is of a married couple sitting behind a stack of tomatoes, washing them one by one. Every unblemished tomato is a deep, rich shade of red.

[^1]: Personally, I don't get what the big deal is about truffles. Generally, I have a strong sense of smell--I once identified blue cheese as a topping in a colleague's sandwich from all the way at the other end of the lunch cafeteria table--but when I've tried truffle-based dishes, the supposedly distinctive aroma just doesn't stand out to me.
