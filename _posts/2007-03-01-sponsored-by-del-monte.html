<p>My buddy made an <a href="http://logicalwaste.blogspot.com/2007/02/str8-acting-omg-wtf.html" title="interesting post">interesting post</a> about the perception of "straight acting" among homosexuals.  It just goes to show how every group has its own prejudices.<br><br>One thing I want to comment on, his comparison between "straight acting" and "banana":<br><br>
<blockquote><span lang="EN-CA">This is analogous to referring to an Asian person as a "banana" (which doesn't seem to carry the same negative connotations).</span><br></p></blockquote>
<p><br>This isn't quite accurate.  The term "banana" is not as neutral as my friend makes it out to be.  Personally, I don't take offense at being called a banana, but the whole concept of an Asian person acting white can be the cause of some friction.  My banana status is ambiguous enough that sometimes I've been able to listen in at conversations between parents of more full-fledged bananas, and I can tell, it's really something that they have strong feelings about.  They sincerely wish that their kids were "more Chinese."  In my own family, there's never been outright unhappiness about the issue, but I can occasionally sense an air of passive disapproval.  (We don't call it "banana" in Cantonese, there's another term for it that I won't even attempt a translation of... it's some shit about bamboo or something.)<br><br>And I can only guess what FOBs think about bananas.  I wouldn't know, because I stay away from <span>those</span> people as much as I can...</p>
