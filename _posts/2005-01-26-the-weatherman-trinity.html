<p>This series of clips basically sum up the essence of the human condition through one of the most trusted and respected professions in the world: the weatherman. Every human being can be categorized into these three groups.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~acchoi/mark-mathis-1.wmv">The Extrovert</a><br><br><br><br>Notice how the anchors kind of egg him on, but you can hear the exasperation and displeasure in their voices.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~acchoi/badweatherman.swf">The Introvert</a><br><br><br><br>This is a university broadcast, and it's probably his first time on air, so you kind of feel for him.... but it's still pretty funny. Especially his futile attempts to point at the projected image, which I'm sure is a very difficult weatherman skill.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~acchoi/tourettesweather.wmv">The Just Plain Nuts</a><br><br><br><br>No explanation needed.<br><br><br><br>(Original links found on <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>)<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
