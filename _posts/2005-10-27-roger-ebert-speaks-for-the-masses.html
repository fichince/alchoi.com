title: Roger Ebert speaks for the masses
---

<p>I was catching up on some Ebert & Roeper shows via their podcast… A couple weeks ago, they reviewed <em>Into the Blue</em>.  Richard Roeper gave it a thumbs down for all the expected reasons: ridiculous plot, mindless action scenes, etc.  Ebert, on the other hand, gave it a thumbs up, to Roeper’s astonishment.  He began his justification of his recommendation thusly (I’m paraphrasing here):</p>
<p>“Jessica Alba is a pretty girl.  She’s pretty in this movie.  So that’s a thumbs up.”</p>
<p>Can’t argue with that, Roger Ebert.  Of course, he tried to give other reasons for liking the movie, but it was altogether unconvincing.  I propose that Ebert & Roeper introduce a “thumb down, penis up” rating for just this purpose.</p>
