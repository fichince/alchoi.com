title: Wheel... Of.... FortAHHHH!
---

<p>I was watching <span>Wheel of Fortune</span> the other day, and I have a message for the producers of the show:  if a contestant can't properly pronounce the 26 letters of the alphabet, please don't let them on the show.  This one player just kept yelling out "letters" and I just couldn't tell what she was saying.<br><br><span>Player:</span>  "I'll spin..."  <span>Spin.</span>  "Is there an AHHHHH?"<br><br><span>Pat Sajak:</span>  "Yes, there are two R's."<br><br><span>Player:</span>  "I'd like to buy a vowel... an AHHHHH."<br><br><span>Pat Sajak:</span>  "There is one I."<br><br><span>Player:</span>  "Spin..."  <span>Spin.</span>  "AHHHHH?"<br><br><span>Pat Sajak:</span>  "No, sorry, there are no Q's."<br><br>Pat Sajak didn't seem to have a problem deciphering it, but I guess that's why he's a game show host and I'm not.  Either that, or there are hours of edited footage on the cutting room floor of Pat Sajak going "What?  What letter did you just say?!"<br><br><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wheel+of+fortune" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/humour" rel="tag"></a><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/funny" rel="tag"></a></p>
