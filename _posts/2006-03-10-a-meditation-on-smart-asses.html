title: A Meditation on Smart-asses
---

<p>There's something about cars and driving causes people to become arrogant and self-important.  A video that's recently been popular on the Net demonstrates the superiority complex that self-prescribed "good drivers" have.<br><br>The video shows a bunch of students that believe they have a point to prove, and then go about trying to prove it in a completely irrelevant manner.  It's called, pompously, "A Meditation On the Speed Limit."  The point they're trying to make is that driving at the speed limit is dangerous, and to illustrate this, they... well, just <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5366552067462745475" title="watch">watch</a>.<br><br><center> <img src="http://img437.imageshack.us/img437/6715/snapshot200603092118214tp.png"></center><br><br>The line that sums up their conceited attitude is when one of them says, with indignation, "We're going to follow the rules, and show them how stupid the rules are."  Here's what I think... you've done nothing but show them how stupid <span>you</span> are.  This little exercise proves nothing about the speed limit, it only proves that if you go and intentionally block traffic, then bad things will happen.  And they have in fact contradicted their original hypothesis: that driving at the speed limit is dangerous.  Clearly, everybody who was driving the speed limit was fine; it was the ones who tried to pass them at a higher speed on the shoulder who got into trouble.  And why were they trying to pass on the shoulder?  Because you were <span>fucking blocking traffic!</span>  Smart-ass student kids these days...<br><br>Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/video" title="video" rel="tag">video</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/driving" title="driving" rel="tag">driving</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/cars" title="cars" rel="tag">cars</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/speed+limit" title="speed limit" rel="tag">speed limit</a></p>
