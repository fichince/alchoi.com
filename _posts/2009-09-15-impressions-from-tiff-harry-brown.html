<p><br>Links: <a title="TIFF site" href="http://www.tiff.net/filmsandschedules/films/harrybrown">TIFF site</a>, <a title="IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289406/">IMDB</a><br><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/">Michael Caine</a> plays Harry Brown, a retired widower living in a bad neighbourhood overrun by drug gangs.  And then his friend gets hurt.  And then he starts killing gang members.  And then the cops get involved.  That's what I felt like when I was watching this movie... it was just a sequence of plot events.  I never got a sense of the characters' motivations and justifications for their actions.  The characters were only there to move the plot along, and I didn't care about them at all.<br><br>For example, there's one scene where the police detective (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607865/">Emily Mortimer</a>) suddenly goes from being confused about the situation to being <i>completely</i> <i>convinced</i> that she's solved the case, all based on what I think was a very vague piece of evidence.  Up to that point, she was portrayed as a fair and thoughtful detective, but then abruptly jumps to a conclusion, only because that's what was needed for the movie to set up its climax.<br><br>Overall, it was a disappointment.  That being said, there are some moments of suspense that did work well, e.g., the scene where Harry goes to buy a gun from some nasty people.  And Michael Caine delivers my favourite one-liner from the festival so far.  After a shootout with a bad guy, he stands victoriously over his injured opponent and says: "You failed to maintain your weapon, son."  Brilliant.<br><br><b>2 out of 5</b></p>
