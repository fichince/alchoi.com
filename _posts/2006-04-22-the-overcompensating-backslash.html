title: The Overcompensating Backslash
---

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You hear a lot of news reporters and journalists on TV and radio referring to website URLs these days.  I have noticed, not without ire, that many of them make the mistake of saying "backslash" when they really mean "slash", e.g. "Visit our site at http-colon-backslash-backslash www-dot-ctv-dot-ca backslash news." <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br> I can only imagine the media personality in her youth, back in the 80's, perhaps working a lowly office job before she got her first reporter gig, running into an unpleasant DOS geek system administrator:<br><br><span>Pre-media personality:</span> "Can you help me with this?  I saved the file to C colon slash documents, but I can't open it anymore..."<br><br><span>DOS geek system administrator:</span> "It's backslash, you idiot!  C colon backslash!  Don't you know how to use a computer?!"<br><br> The emotional trauma of being yelled at by a scruffy, heavy-set man has undoubtedly stayed with our media personality all these years, and now she subconsciously overcompensates every time she sees a slash.  That is, until this happens:<br><br><span>Media personality:</span> "Can you help me with this?  I want to put up a link for http-colon-backslash-backslash microsoft dot com backslash windows to this story I did on software obsolescence..."<br><br><span>Web geek system administrator:</span>  "It's slash, you idiot!  Don't you know how to use the Internet?!"<br><br> Emotional Trauma 2.0<br><br><br><a href="http://technorati.com/tags/internet" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/dos" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/journalists" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/media" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/geek" rel="tag"></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/humour" rel="tag"></a></div>
