<p><span>This</span> is exactly why asian people have no business, uh.... doing science?<br><br><a href="http://mixedreality.nus.edu.sg/MEDIA/all%20videos/PI/PI%28web%29.mov">http://mixedreality.nus.edu.sg/MEDIA/all%20videos/PI/PI(web).mov</a><br><br>This can best be described as a remote control human-chicken interface.  Apparently, there is demand for pet chicken owners to be able to pet their chickens while they're at work.  I wonder if there's a ROAST function.</p>
