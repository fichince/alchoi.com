That's pretty much all I can say about the plot without giving away the various twists.  What I found interesting about this film was that the three main characters are the only people in the whole movie.  Also, almost the entire story takes place within 2 rooms<br>in an apartment, and everything develops from the dialogue and interaction between the characters and the performances, which were great.  In that sense, it's kind of like a play.  On the other hand, it's shot with some stylish cinematography, which gives it sufficient "movie-ness" that you might not even notice how small the scope is.  (Some people in the audience actually chuckled when the credits rolled and they realized that there were only 3 people in it.)<br><br>Excellent acting, great script, great style, and some very cool and unexpected twists.  My favourite of the festival so far.<br><br><b>4 out of 5</b></p>
