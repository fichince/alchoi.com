<p>The song: “Squeeze Box” <br>The artist: The Who</p>
<p>Ahem…</p>
<ul>
<li>“Mama’s got a squeeze box / She wears on her chest / And when Daddy comes home / He never gets no rest” </li>
<li>“Mama’s got a squeeze box / Daddy never sleeps at night” </li>
<li>“She goes in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out” </li>
<li>“She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me”</li>
</ul>
<p>   And, once again:  
<ul>
<li>“Mama’s got a squeeze box / Daddy never sleeps at night”</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I know it’s an accordian, but still… ew.</p>
