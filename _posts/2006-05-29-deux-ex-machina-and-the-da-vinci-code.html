title: Deux Ex Machina and The Da Vinci Code
---

<p>Those who know me know that I don't like The Da Vinci Code.&nbsp; I've always maintained that I find the subject matter interesting, but the ridiculous plot and poor writing completely cancel that out.&nbsp; After recently seeing the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382625/">movie</a>, I have been able to better crystallize my criticisms of the story; i.e. it's much easier to see the crap when it's all condensed together in a short time frame.<br /><br />One major annoyance that I had with the plot was the abundance of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina">deux ex machina</a>" moments.&nbsp; These are moments in a story where the characters seem to be in a hopeless situation, but then something completely unexpected or unrealistic comes along to bail them out of it.&nbsp; This kind of plot device is okay if used in moderation, but it happens way too many times in Da Vinci.&nbsp; To wit:<br /><br />(Spoilers ahead...&nbsp; although the spoilers basically amount to: they don't die.)<br /> </p><ul><li>Robert and Sophie are trapped in an armoured truck.&nbsp; A villain is pointing a gun at them.&nbsp; Instead of just shooting them, the villain decides to close the door of the truck, right onto a bullet shell casing that Robert had just happened to kick into the doorway.&nbsp; The door bounces back and the villain comically bangs his head on it.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I know in the book some explanation is given as to why he pushed the shell casing into the doorway... but really, I'm not going to go and read it again.<br /> </li><li>Robert and Sophie are standing in some church.&nbsp; A villain is pointing a gun at them.&nbsp; Suddenly, a dove flies by and distracts the villain, who then proceeds to forget how to shoot a gun.&nbsp; He fires and misses.&nbsp; A dove flies by!&nbsp; What is this, a John Woo movie?<br /> </li><li>Ian McKellan is sitting in his house.&nbsp; A villain (Silas the crazy monk) is pointing a gun at him.&nbsp; He grabs his crutches and swings.&nbsp; Incredibly, Silas, who we have just seen killing a nun with a single, well-timed and ruthless strike, fails to react fast enough to shoot Ian McKellan at point blank range.&nbsp; I would expect Jackie Chan to be able to pull a move like that off, but Ian McKellan?&nbsp; And this isn't Gandalf Ian McKellan.&nbsp; Or Magneto Ian McKellan.&nbsp; It's crippled scholar Ian McKellan!</li></ul><p><br />And that's all I have to say about that.</p>
