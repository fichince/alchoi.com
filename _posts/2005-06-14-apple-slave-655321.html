<p>I have never been a big fan of Apple. Their philosophy of computer-as-appliance has always struck me as a bit repulsive. It's easy to dislike Microsoft (and I do) for keeping everything closed and proprietary, but in some ways Apple is even worse. At least with a Windows PC, you can open the thing up and add and remove parts yourself.<br><br>Just look at the iPod, for example. The fact that it uses a non-standard connector to interface with the PC means that there are a whole bunch of products (e.g. USB cables) that you can't use with the iPod, and also that there are a whole bunch of iPod-specific products that don't work with anything else.<br><br><span>Yeah, but that means the good Apple engineers can optimize for the hardware and make it work really fast...</span><br><br>Uh... but it's harmful to consumers when these incompatibilities arise... it takes away their choices...<br><br><span>That's okay, if everybody uses an iPod, then there won't be any incompatibilities... and it'll be really easy to find iPod-compatible products because all the manufacturers will be on the iPod bandwagon...</span><br><br>But... but... Apple is an evil corporation... they're trying to take over the world!<br><br><span>Just look at this iPod... it's so shiny and pretty... and cute..</span><br><br>NOOOOO!!!!!<br><br><span>Apple rulzzzzz!!!</span></p>
